ZubaBot
=======
Hi! I just wanted to note here that I have noted many times before, I made ZubaBot from another GitHub composition called "basicBot". Find it here: https://github.com/Yemasthui/basicBot

I took that composition, and modified it (added commands, took away some, changed things around) to make ZubaBot.

BIG THANKS TO:
Yemasthui (he made the basicBot (which is the base code for ZubaBot) so all credit goes to him)

More to come as I change more things around with ZubaBot.
